Refactoring
-----------

* Put (at least) core components in namespace jd to allow ADL: avoids ugly
  forward declarations of operator<< before #include <luabind/operator.hpp>
  and is good style anyway.
* StateManager / State needs to be completely rewritten: It's way to
  complicated without providing any benefits and, worse, lowers flexibility.
* Get rid of LuaComponent::bindLuaPart(): Maybe luabind::adopt() is now
  capable of replacing it.
* Exceptions: Use boost::exception/error_info system or at least a proper
  hierarchy.
