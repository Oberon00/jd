JadeEngine
==========

**JadeEngine** (or '**jd**' for short) is a game Engine written in *C++* for
*Lua* with *SFML* for graphics and audio (not implemented yet), *PhysFS* as
virtual file system and a custom *TMX-Loader* (Tiled Map Editor's format).

For the libraries needed to build, see section 3
"Verwendete Programmiersprachen, Bibliotheken und Tools" in FloodFill.pdf. The
project will most likely only build on MSVC11 out of the box.

Note that jd uses a patched version of luabind and lua (for the latter see
http://www.lua.org/bugs.html, especially the GC bug
http://www.lua.org/bugs.html#5.2.1-3).
Patches to luabind:
 * unset metatable of destroyed objects
 * fix weak_ref
   (http://lua.2524044.n2.nabble.com/weak-ref-issue-patch-td7581558.html)

I know that the information provided makes it quite difficult to build the
project. That's because I don't really believe that someone other than me wants
to do that anytime soon. If you intend to do that, please contact me so that I
can give more information or even prebuilt dependencies.
